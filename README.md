# Spot in

## Introduction

SpotIn is a place for registering spots. Spots can take place in the virtual or in the physical world. They capture the context and the circumstances that form the setting for an event. Each spot receives a stable Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that can be used for referencing purposes. Spots can contain arbitrary metadata describing a context and circumstances. Additionally, spots can redirect the user to the original source of information. Once created, spots are searchable by places and by keywords.
